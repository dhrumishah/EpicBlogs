## What things I have done?
- Implemented 1 custom hook
- Could not implement fetching of blogs in SSR since fetching uses `publicClient` from `viem` library and that hook cannot be called inside SSR.
- I have written code in Typescript ensuring null checks, type safety, etc.
- I have taken care of SEO by adding 2 line content on home page, adding `link` tags whenever something has redirection to other page since Google Bots give priority to `link` tags instead of `div` tags.
- I have used `Rainbowkit` for connecting wallet to the Dapp.
- I have made sure the code is reusable such as use of `Navbar` component.
- I have also used `Toastify` library to give good User experience to the user.
